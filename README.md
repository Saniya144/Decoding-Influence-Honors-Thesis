## Abstract
Business elites and other interest groups, such as labor unions, play a key role in shaping labor policy in the United States, yet the extent and mechanisms of their influence remain unclear. This study comparatively examines how business associations and labor interest groups influence labor policy through the bureaucratic rulemaking process. Using quantitative text analysis via the Wordfish package in R, I estimate the policy positions of interest groups based on their submitted public comments and compare them to the final policy texts to identify the likely “winners” and “losers” in six labor regulations. To further explore the conditions under which each group’s preferences are reflected in policy outcomes, I apply Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to uncover combinations of factors, such as issue salience and comment quality, that consistently correspond with favorable policy outcomes. Findings reveal that business groups saw favorable conditions within the labor regulations policy sphere even when their comments did not reflect high quality However, we also found that labor groups hold considerable power through their high resource nature, well-cited comments and advocacy on low salience issues.
