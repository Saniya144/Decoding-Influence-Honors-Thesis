adopted in 1971 (36 FR 10474), as well as by the rule proposed in 1990 (55 FR 13360, 13363), are not covered by the current standard. In the 2010 proposed rule and the 2016 final rule, OSHA referred to these stairs as ''stairs serving floating roof tanks'' but did not call them ''articulated stairs.'' (75 FR 28862,
28882; 81 FR at 82555). OSHA is now
clarifying that all articulated stairs used in general industry, not just those serving floating roof tanks, remain excluded from coverage by § 1910.25. By not including this exception, the standard would require all articulated stairs that do not serve floating roof tanks, including those that were

  (5) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (p) of this section.
  (i) Example 1: Responsible party for a transaction with multiple broker-dealers. (A) Facts. CO is a domestic clearing organization and is not a broker as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. CO serves as a central counterparty clearing and settlement service provider for derivatives exchanges in the United States. EB and CB are brokers organized in the United States and members of CO. FC, a foreign corporation, instructs EB to execute the purchase of a call option that is a specified ELI (as described in paragraph
(e) of this section). EB effects the trade for FC on the exchange and then, as instructed by FC, transfers the option to CB to be cleared with CO. The exchange matches FC's order with an order for a written call option with the same terms and then sends the matched trade to CO, which clears the trade. CB and the clearing member representing the person who sold the call option settle the trade with CO. Upon receiving the matched trade, the option contracts are novated and CO becomes the counterparty to CB and the counterparty to the clearing member representing the person who sold the call option.
  (B) Analysis. Both EB and CB are broker- dealers acting on behalf of FC for a potential section 871(m) transaction. Under paragraph (p)(1)(iii) of this section, however, only CB is required to make the determinations described in paragraph (p) of this section because CB has the ongoing customer relationship with FC with respect to the call option.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Summary and Explanation
Ladders (§ 1910.23)
  Current § 1910.23(d)(4) requires employers to ensure that the side rails of through or side-step ladders extend 42 inches above the top of the access level or landing platform served by the ladder. As stated in the preamble to the final rule, the agency intended workers to have sufficient handholds ''at least 42 inches'' above the highest level on which they will step when reaching the access level (81 FR 82494, 82542).
OSHA is correcting this error by revising § 1910.23(d)(4) to state that 42 inches is the minimum-not the exact- measurement for fixed ladder side rail extensions.
Stairways (§ 1910.25)
  Current § 1910.25(a) sets forth the types of stairways covered under this section. These include all stairways except for stairs serving floating roof tanks, stairs on scaffolds, stairs designed into machines or equipment, and stairs on self-propelled motorized equipment. In this correction, OSHA is clarifying that articulated stairs, which were excluded from coverage by the rule

requirements set forth in § 1910.25. OSHA did not intend for any types of articulated stairs to be covered by the standard.
The figure at 29 CFR 1910.25(c)
immediately after Table D-1 does not have a title even though it is referred to as Figure D-8 in § 1910.25(c)(4). The title of the figure was included in the proposed rule (75 FR at 29137) but mistakenly left out of the final rule (81 FR at 82989). This document adds the missing title to the figure: ''Figure D-8- Dimensions of Standard Stairs''.
Scaffolds and Rope Descent Systems (§ 1910.27)
  In paragraph (b)(1)(i) of § 1910.27, OSHA is correcting a typographical error in the metric parenthetical for 5,000 pounds. The parenthetical currently states the metric equivalent to 5,000 pounds is 268 kg. The correct metric equivalent is 2,268 kg.
Fall Protection Systems and Falling Object Protection-Criteria and Practices (§ 1910.29)
  OSHA is correcting Figure D-11 to include labels identifying the top rail and end post in the top diagram of the figure. The words ''top rail'' and ''end post'' were mistakenly omitted when the final rule was published in the Federal Register (81 FR at 82995).
Personal Fall Protection Systems (§ 1910.140)
  Current § 1910.140(c)(8) requires D- rings, snaphooks, and carabiners to be proof tested to a minimum tensile load of 3,600 pounds without cracking, breaking, or incurring permanent deformation. The provision also requires the gate strength of snaphooks and carabiners to be proof tested to 3,600 pounds in all directions. In the November 18, 2016, final rule (81 FR at 82653), OSHA intended to be consistent with the ANSI/ASSE Z359.12-2009
consensus standard, Connecting

Components for Personal Fall Arrest Systems. That consensus standard requires snaphooks, carabiners, and D- rings (and other hardware) to be proof tested to 3,600 pounds (ANSI/ASSE Z359.12-2009, section 3.1.1.6) and requires the gate of snaphooks and carabiners to be capable of withstanding a minimum load of 3,600 pounds without the gate separating from the nose of the snaphook or carabiner body by more than 0.125 inches (ANSI/ASSE Z359.12-2009, section 3.1.1.3). OSHA
correctly added the first requirement to the 2016 final rule-namely the requirement that snaphooks, carabiners, and D-rings be proof tested to 3,600 pounds. When it came to the gate strength requirement, OSHA mistakenly added the requirement that the gate strength of snaphooks and carabiners be proof tested to 3,600 pounds in all directions instead of adding the intended requirement that the gate of snaphooks and carabiners be capable of withstanding a minimum load of 3,600 pounds without the gate separating from the nose of the snaphook or carabiner body by more than 0.125 inches. It should also be noted that proof testing of the gates of snaphooks and carabiners could be destructive to the equipment, rendering them unsafe for workers in the field. In this document, OSHA is correcting the gate strength provision to be consistent with the national consensus standard, as originally intended, and as stated in letters of interpretation to the National Association of Tower Erectors (NATE) (see response to question 5 here: https:// www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standard interpretations/2017-08-18) and the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) (see response to question 1 here: https://www.osha.gov/ laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2017-  08-31).
Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution (§ 1910.269)
  Section 1910.269(h)(2) contains references to ladder standards

(§§ 1910.25(d)(2)(i) and (iii) and 1910.26(c)(3)(iii)) that are not the correct references. OSHA is revising
§ 1910.269(h)(2) by replacing the incorrect references with the correct references, which are § 1910.23(c)(4) and (9).
II. Exemption From Notice-and- Comment Procedures
  OSHA determined that this rulemaking is not subject to the procedures for public notice and comment specified in Section 4 of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553), Section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(b)), and 29 CFR 1911.5. This
rulemaking only corrects typographical, formatting, and clerical errors, and provides more information about the requirements of some provisions. As it does not affect or change any existing rights or obligations, no stakeholder is likely to object to these corrections.
Therefore, the agency finds good cause that public notice and comment are unnecessary within the meaning of 5
U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), 29 U.S.C. 655(b), and 29 CFR 1911.5.

Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Northeast Multispecies Fishery; Closure of the Regular B Days-at-Sea Program for the Remainder of Fishing Year 2019
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.
ACTION: Temporary rule; inseason closure.


SUMMARY: This action closes the Regular B Days-at-Sea Program and prohibits the use of Regular B Days-at-Sea for all Northeast multispecies vessels for the

remainder of fishing year 2019, through April 30, 2020. This action is being taken because the common pool fishery is projected to have caught 77 percent of the Incidental Catch Total Allowable Catch for Gulf of Maine Cod. We have projected that continuation of the program would undermine the achievements of the objectives of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan and the Regular B Days-at-Sea Program.
DATES: This action is effective December 16, 2019, through April 30, 2020.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Spencer Talmage, Fishery Management Specialist, (978) 281-9232.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Federal
regulations at 50 CFR 648.85(b)(6)(vi) authorize the Regional Administrator to close the Regular B Days-at-Sea (DAS) program by prohibiting the use of Regular B DAS when the continuation of the program would undermine the achievement of the objectives of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP) or the Regular B DAS Program.
  Framework Adjustment 58 to the Northeast Multispecies FMP (84 FR 34799, July 19, 2019) implemented Common Pool Incidental Catch Total Allowable Catches (TAC) for the Regular B DAS Program for the 2019 and 2020 fishing years, listed in Table 1 below.
The Incidental Catch TAC for Gulf of Maine (GOM) Cod is very small, at 242.5 lb (110 kg).

  Based on information reported through October 12, 2019, the common pool fishery is projected to have caught approximately 186 lb (84.4 kg), or 77 percent of the 242.5-lb (110-kg) Incidental Catch Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for GOM cod.
  The trip limit for GOM cod for common pool vessels participating in the Regular B DAS Program is 25 lb per trip. At this trip limit, the common pool fishing has only two trips remaining before it achieves the Incidental Catch TAC.
  
Given the current trip limit, and past fishing behavior, the common pool may achieve or exceed the GOM Cod Incidental Catch TAC in a very short amount of time. Additionally, this may happen sooner if effort in the Regular B DAS Program increases. Even at the current low level of effort in the Regular B DAS Program, we may not be able to close the program in time to prevent the common pool from exceeding the GOM Cod Incidental Catch TAC, which would be detrimental to the fishery.
  
As a result, it is unlikely that we can effectively limit catch to the GOM Cod Incidental Catch TAC during the remainder of fishing year 2019. We project that continuation of the Regular B DAS program would undermine the achievement of the objectives of the Northeast Multispecies FMP and the Regular B DAS Program. Effective December 16, 2019, the Regular B DAS Program is closed and use of Regular B DAS is prohibited for the remainder of the 2019 fishing year, through April 30, 2020. This applies to all vessels issued
