Re:  A More Public-Friendly Informal Hearing
Comment on Walking-Working Surfaces and Personal Protective Equipment (Fall Protection Systems) Public Informal Hearing 
[29 CFR part 1910, subparts D and I, as published on May 24, 2010 (73 FR 28862)]

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of OSHA:

The Federal Register of November 12, 2010, pp. 69472-69473, published a notice under the direction of David Michaels, PhD, MPH, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, detailing the "Preparations for December UN Meetings on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)" for which a public meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2010, from 1-3 p.m., at The U.S. Department of Labor, Francis Perkins Building, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, Room N4437 C&D.  At that time OSHA has invited interested parties to participate in an open, informal public meeting to discuss proposals in preparation for the 20th session of the United Nations Subcommittee of Experts on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (UNSCEGHS).  The UNSCEGHS meeting will be held December 7-9, 2010, in Geneva, Switzerland. OSHA, along with the U.S. Interagency GHS Coordinating Group, plans to consider the comments and information gathered at this public meeting when developing the U.S Government positions for the UNSCEGHS meeting.  All this being said, OSHA has provided Conference Call-In Capability (CCIC) for this meeting. It is instructed "To participate by telephone, dial 1-888-946-7303, and enter participant passcode 34137. During the call, please press *6 to mute/unmute your individual lines."

Also, the Presidential Document "Transparency and Open Government" memorandum signed on January 21, 2009 and published in the Federal Register on Monday, January 26, 2009 at pp. 4685-4686, stated "Executive departments and agencies should offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information. Executive departments and agencies should also solicit public input on how we can increase and improve opportunities for public participation in Government."

Question:
With the respect of these observations in mind, would it not be beneficial for all concerned to use the same facilities and communication techniques (CCIC) as are being accomplished with the GHS meeting to permit the public to hear and/or participate in this Tuesday, January 18, 2011 (and, if necessary, on subsequent days) informal public hearing on the proposed rule on Walking-Working Surfaces and Personal Protective Equipment (Fall Protection Systems)?


Respectfully submitted,
