NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD
29 CFR Part 103
RIN 3142-AA21

Standard for Determining Joint Employer Status
AGENCY: National Labor Relations Board.
ACTION: Final rule; delay of effective date.


SUMMARY: On October 27, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (Board) published a final rule rescinding and replacing its rule regarding the standard for determining joint employer status under the National Labor Relations Act. The Board hereby amends that rule to change the effective date from December 26, 2023, to February 26, 2024. The purpose of this amendment is to

facilitate the resolution of the legal challenges with respect to the rule. DATES: The effective date of the final rule amending 29 CFR part 103
published at 88 FR 73946, October 27,
2023, is delayed from December 26,
2023, to February 26, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On
October 27, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board published a final rule rescinding and replacing the final rule entitled ''Joint Employer Status Under the National Labor Relations Act,'' which was published on February 26, 2020, and took effect on April 27, 2020. The final rule establishes a new standard for determining whether two employers, as defined in the Act, are joint employers of particular employees within the meaning of the Act. The Board believes that this rule will more explicitly ground the joint-employer standard in established common-law agency principles and provide guidance to parties covered by the Act regarding their rights and responsibilities when more than one statutory employer possesses the authority to control or exercises the power to control particular employees' essential terms and conditions of employment. Under the final rule, an entity may be considered
a joint employer of another employer's employees if the two share or codetermine the employees' essential terms and conditions of employment.
On November 6, 2023, a petition for
review of the final rule was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Service Employees International Union v.
NLRB, No. 23-1309 (D.C. Cir.). Then, on
November 19, 2023, a challenge to the final rule was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, et. al v. NLRB, No. 6:23-cv-00553 (E.D. Tex.). The Board has determined that postponing the effective date of the rule would facilitate the resolution of the legal challenges that have been filed with respect to the

Federal Register / Vol. 88, No. 224 / Wednesday, November 22, 2023 / Rules and Regulations	81345


rule. 5 U.S.C. 705. Accordingly, the Board has decided to change the effective date of the rule from December 26, 2023 to February 26, 2024.
  Dated: November 17, 2023. Roxanne L. Rothschild, Executive Secretary.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
Office of the Secretary 31 CFR Part 1
RIN 1506-AB63
Privacy Act of 1974; Exemptions
AGENCY: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Treasury.
ACTION: Final rule.


SUMMARY: In accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, Treasury is issuing a final rule, exempting a new system of records, entitled ''FinCEN .004- Beneficial Ownership Information System,'' from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) System is being established to implement the beneficial ownership information reporting and access requirements set out in the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which was enacted on January 1, 2021, as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. The exemptions are intended to increase the value of the system for law enforcement purposes and to comply with the CTA's prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure of certain information.
DATES: This rule is effective January 1, 2024.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For
questions about this document and privacy issues, contact: Ryan Law, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Privacy, Transparency, and Records at U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20220; telephone: (202) 622-5710.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background
  On September 14, 2023, Treasury published a notice of proposed rulemaking (the ''NPRM'') in the Federal Register, 88 FR 63039, proposing to exempt a system of records, FinCEN .004-Beneficial Ownership Information System (the ''BOI System''), from provisions of the Privacy Act. Pursuant to the CTA,

use the BOI System to maintain BOI submitted to FinCEN by certain corporations, limited liability companies, and other entities created in or registered to do business in the United States (''reporting companies''). BOI includes identifying information associated with the reporting companies themselves, their beneficial owners, and their company applicants. The BOI System will also maintain information about individuals who apply to FinCEN for FinCEN identifiers, which beneficial owners and company applicants will be able to use in lieu of the information required to be reported about them by reporting companies.1 Information provided to FinCEN to obtain a FinCEN identifier will be disclosed to authorized recipients for authorized purposes in the same way and to the same extent as BOI. The CTA authorizes FinCEN to disclose BOI to five categories of authorized recipients that include foreign and domestic law enforcement agencies, but do not include beneficial owners, company applicants, or individuals who have obtained FinCEN identifiers.
The Privacy Act contains certain
requirements regarding the maintenance and disclosure of a system of records.
Those requirements may differ from, or conflict with, the comprehensive requirements for maintaining and disclosing BOI specified in the CTA. In any case where the CTA conflicts with the Privacy Act, FinCEN believes that the more detailed, specific provisions of the CTA supersede any contrary provisions in the Privacy Act.
Nevertheless, to the extent certain provisions of the Privacy Act were to apply, and without conceding that they do, Treasury is publishing this final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k), to exempt the BOI System from those provisions.
Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the head of
a Federal agency may promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a if the system of records is maintained by an agency or component thereof that performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, including police efforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime or to apprehend criminals, and the activities of prosecutors, courts, correctional, probation, pardon, or parole authorities and which consists of
(a) information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual

   1 Reporting companies will not use the FinCEN identifier application to request a FinCEN identifier but instead will request a FinCEN identifier when

criminal offenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying data and notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and probation status; (b) information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or (c) reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision.
  Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the head of a Federal agency may promulgate rules to exempt a system of records from certain provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a if the system of records is ''investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes, other than material within the scope of subsection (j)(2) of this section.''
  The reasons for exempting the BOI System from sections (c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e)(1), (e)(2),
(e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and
(g) of the Privacy Act are as follows:
(1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and
(f)(2), (f)(3), and (f)(5) grant individuals access to records containing information about them. An exemption from these provisions is appropriate because the CTA prohibits FinCEN from disclosing BOI except to five categories of authorized recipients; 2 these categories do not include beneficial owners, company applicants, or individuals who have obtained FinCEN identifiers.
Because individuals who are the subject of the records in the BOI System are not included in any of those categories, the application of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (f)(3), and (f)(5) to the BOI System would contravene the CTA's disclosure restrictions.
(2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (f)(1)
enable individuals to inquire whether a system of records contains records about them. An exemption from these provisions is appropriate because allowing individuals involved in illegal activity to learn that FinCEN has information concerning those individuals that could lead to them being identified for investigation could undercut the CTA mandate that the BOI System be ''highly useful'' to law enforcement agencies. For instance, such notice could prompt individuals engaged in illegal activity to: (a) take steps to avoid detection; (b) begin, continue, or resume illegal conduct upon learning that they are not identified in the system of records; or (c)



starting on January 1, 2024, FinCEN will

they submit a BOI report.	2 31 U.S.C. 5337(c)(2).
